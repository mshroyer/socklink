# tsock.sh Changelog

## v0.2.0

- Renames the project to "socklink" to avoid confusion with the existing
  tsocks proxying library.
- Adds installation script for .tmux.conf and .bashrc hooks.

## v0.1.0

- Some improvements over the original version from my "config" repo to
  simplify querying the active client TTY and ensure non-default socket paths
  will be honored.
- Added automated tests on GitHub and SourceHut.
- Copied release automation from CoursePointer.
